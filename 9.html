   <i> <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 98, 255)"><b>About Hardware Networking:</b></h2></i>


    <p style="color:white"><i>
        Network hardware is a set of physical or network devices that are essential for interaction and communication between hardware units operational on a computer network. These are dedicated hardware components that connect to each other and enable a network to function effectively and efficiently.

        Today, technology has penetrated its tentacles into every nook and corner of our lives. It has gone from being just an industry add-on to an inevitable necessity. As tech enablement is driving the industrial transformation, it’s important for businesses to build a network that is secure, reliable and keeps the users in touch with their applications. The core of this very foundation is leveraged by the basic network hardware.
        
        Network hardware plays a key role as industries grow as it supports scalability. It integrates any number of components depending on the enterprise’s needs. Network hardware helps establish an effective mode of communication, thereby improving the business standards. It also promotes multiprocessing and enables sharing of resources, information, and software with ease.

      <i> <h2 style="color:red"><b>Why Is Used For Hardware Networking:</b></h2>

        <p style="color:white">

            Network interface cards: A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware unit installed on a computer, which allows it to connect to a network. It is typically in the form of a circuit board or chip. In most modern machines, NICs are built into the motherboards, while in some computers, an extra expansion card in the form of a small circuit board is added externally.
            Network cables: Cables connect different devices on a network. Today, most networks have cables over a wireless connection as they are more secure, i.e., less prone to attacks, and at the same time carry larger volumes of data per second.
