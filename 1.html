   <i> <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 98, 255)"><b>About Java :</b></h2></i>


    <p style="color:white"><i>JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
     
     </i>
        <p style="color:white"><i>
        History: Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
       
       
        <p style="color:white">
        In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
        

        <p style="color:white">
        On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under open-source distribution terms.

        <h2 style="color:red"><b>Why Is Used For Java :</b></h2>

        <p style="color:white">

            Java is the most popular, widely used object-oriented programming language. The security feature of Java makes it popular and widely used. It used by many Java enthusiasts for different purposes. By using Java, we can develop a variety of applications such as enterprise applications, network applications, desktop applications, web applications, games, android app, and many more. In this section, we will focus on what is Java used for, the applications of Java, and why we use Java.

            What is Java Used For?
            

            <p style="color:white">
                One of the essential reasons for Java's popularity is the cross-platform compatible and built-in security. Java program can run on any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. Programs operate on various computers. Java is used by many banks, manufacturers, insurance organizations, utilities, and retailers. It is the reason that major industries ruled by Java.

                In this section, we will discuss what makes Java so popular and what are the major industries that uses Java programming language.

            <p style="color:white">
            Java is an object-oriented programming language. The object contains no references to data outside of themselves.</p>
            
            <p style="color:white">
                The language is thought to be fairly simple, including a library of classes. The class library or Java APIs are a part of Java as the language itself. </p>
                
                
                <p style="color:white">
                    Although the language only has 50 keywords, the Java API contains thousands of classes and more than tens of thousands of methods that we can use in Java applications.
